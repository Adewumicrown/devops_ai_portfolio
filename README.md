# DevOps Engineering & AI Automation Portfolio
> **Mission:** Architecting scalable infrastructure and autonomous workflows to bridge the gap between traditional DevOps and AI-driven efficiency.

## 🏛️ System Architecture


This repository serves as a "Live Experience Bag," documenting the transition from manual system administration to automated, containerized infrastructure.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- **`01-learning-labs/`**: Deep-dives into core Linux, Docker networking, and initial tool configurations.
- **`02-task-manager-app/`**: A full-stack, production-ready application.
    - `/frontend`: React/Vite application containerized with custom Nginx Alpine images.
    - `/backend`: PostgreSQL database with automated schema migrations and seeding.
    - `/automation`: n8n workflows designed for health monitoring and data orchestration.

## 🚀 Active Project: TaskApp1 (Integrated DevOps & AI)
**Status:** Phase 1 - Containerization & Persistence (Active)

### Key Technical Achievements:
* **Production-Grade Docker Builds:** Implemented multi-stage-style builds to serve optimized React assets via lightweight Nginx Alpine containers.
* **Database Orchestration:** Developed idempotent PostgreSQL schemas and seeding scripts to ensure reproducible environments.
* **Autonomous Monitoring:** (Day 4 Goal) Engineered an n8n-based "Uptime Guardian" to monitor service health and trigger automated recovery alerts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Docker Compose, Linux (Ubuntu/WSL)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **AI & Automation:** n8n, (Planned: Make, Zapier)
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Nginx

## 📈 The Journey to June
- [x] **February:** Containerization, SQL Schema Design, and n8n Database Integration.
- [ ] **March:** CI/CD via GitHub Actions and cloud deployment.
- [ ] **April:** Advanced AI Automations (OpenAI API + n8n).
- [ ] **May/June:** Commercial Portfolio Readiness & Client Outreach.
