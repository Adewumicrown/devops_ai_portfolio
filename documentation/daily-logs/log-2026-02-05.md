Focus: Infrastructure Integration & Docker-to-Host Networking

✅ Completed Today
n8n & Postgres Bridge: Successfully connected a containerized n8n instance to a native PostgreSQL database running on the WSL host.

Network Troubleshooting: Identified and resolved "Host Not Found" and "Connection Refused" errors by mapping the Docker bridge gateway.

Database Security Configuration: Modified pg_hba.conf and postgresql.conf to allow external connections via the Docker network interface.

Workflow Logic: Created a functional SQL node in n8n that queries the tasks table for incomplete entries using SELECT and WHERE filters.

Version Control: Exported the n8n workflow as a .json file and synced it to the GitHub repository.

🛠️ Technical Insights
Host Gateway: Learned that host.docker.internal acts as a DNS bridge between containers and the host OS.

HBA (Host-Based Authentication): Understood that even if a database is "listening," the pg_hba.conf file acts as a firewall that must explicitly permit specific network ranges (like 0.0.0.0/0).

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Realized that n8n workflows can be stored as code (JSON), making them portable and reproducible.

🚀 Next Goal
Connect the Google Tasks API to n8n to turn database queries into real-time mobile notifications.
