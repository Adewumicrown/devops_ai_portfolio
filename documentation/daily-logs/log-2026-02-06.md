✅ What We Accomplished
Database Debugging: Resolved a Foreign Key Constraint error by creating a valid user in the users table.

Schema Discovery: Used \d users to identify the correct column names (username vs name).

Pipeline Integration: Successfully connected n8n to Google Tasks, moving data from a local database to a cloud-based productivity tool.

API Troubleshooting: Diagnosed why notifications weren't "popping up" (missing ISO 8601 Due Dates).
