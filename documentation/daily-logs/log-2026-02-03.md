# Daily Log: February 3>, 2026
**Focus:** Production Builds & Database Seeding

## ✅ Completed Today
- **Frontend Containerization:** Migrated from source-code mounting to a production-ready Nginx build using `npm run build`.
- **Database Schema Migration:** Resolved "column does not exist" errors by refactoring the `schema.sql` with idempotent `DROP/CREATE` logic.
- **Data Seeding:** Successfully populated PostgreSQL with initial task data using `psql`.
- **GitHub Restructuring:** Reorganized the repository into a Monorepo structure (`/01-learning-labs`, `/02-task-manager-app`).

## 🛠️ Technical Insights
- **Docker Context:** Learned that the `.` in `docker build` is the "context," and without it, Docker can't see the local files.
- **Nginx Permissions:** Fixed a "blank white page" issue by ensuring the `dist` folder was correctly copied and permissions were set to `644`.

## 🚀 Tomorrow's Goal
- Establish the **n8n-to-Postgres** bridge to begin AI-driven task notifications.
